## About me

Hi there! My name is Sridhar (pronounced sh-ree-dhur).

I am a PhD student at the **Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems** in Magdeburg, Germany. There, I work within the _Computational Methods in Systems and Control Theory_ (CSC) group which is headed by [Prof. Peter Benner](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/person/26532/16319). My PhD work is about _Model Order Reduction_, a family of numerical methods and algorithms that aim to simplify/reduce the simulation time of mathematical models of large-scale systems, without compromising on accuracy. I am supervised by [Dr. Lihong Feng](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/person/26568/2316). 
I began my PhD in 2017. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelors and Masters degrees in electrical engineering in 2013 and 2016, respectively.

## Research Interests

My main areas of interest are:

- Model Order Reduction
- Numerical Linear Algebra
- Reduced Basis Method

More recently, I am also getting myself familiar with _Scientific Machine Leaning_.
